## THEORY
## Differential Amplifier

A circuit that amplifies that amplifies the difference between two input signals is called 
as differential amplifier. It is useful in instrumentation amplifier. If the two input signals are the 
same, the output should be zero. Differential amplifier with a single op-amp has the exact gain of 
an inverting amplifier and it is given as

## PROCEDURE:  
## Differential amplifier 
1. Select the value of R1, R2, R3 & Rf such that R1=R2 and R3=Rf.  
2. Connect the circuit as per as the circuit diagram.  
3. Provide constant input voltage Vin1 to Non-inverting terminal of op-amp through R1 & 
constant input voltage Vin2 to inverting terminal of op-amp through R2.  
4. Measure the output voltage using DSO.  
5. Calculate the theoretical Vo and compare it with practical Vo.  
6. Practical output & theoretical calculation should be approximately equal.  
7. Plot the graph of the input wave versus output wave for any one practical case.

performance was successfully tested using op-amp IC 741.
